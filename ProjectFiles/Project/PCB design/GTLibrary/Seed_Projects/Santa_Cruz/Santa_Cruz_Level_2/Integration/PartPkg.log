Job Name: C:\cad\CentralLibs\JPK_Lib\Seed_Projects\Santa_Cruz\Santa_Cruz_Level1\Santa_Cruz_Level1\Santa_Cruz_Level1.prj


     Packager     Version: 06.001207.00

     The root of this design is at "C:\cad\CentralLibs\JPK_Lib\Seed_Projects\Santa_Cruz\Santa_Cruz_Level1\Santa_Cruz_Level1\Santa_Cruz_1.sbk".

     The FLATNETNAMEs status indicates that the present set
      of schematic netnames should be used to update the
      FLATNETNAMEs.

     The Disable Repackage status indicates that 
      Repackaging should be allowed.

     The PCB Design Path this design is at "C:\cad\CentralLibs\JPK_Lib\Seed_Projects\Santa_Cruz\Santa_Cruz_Level1\Santa_Cruz_Level1\PCB\Santa_Cruz_Level1.pcb".

     The Central Library is at "C:\cad\CentralLibs\JPK_Lib\JPK_Lib.lmc".

     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the CDB and to replace any duplicates found in the
      Target PDB.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Properties that have been checked off in the Property Definition Editor
      found at Library Manager/Common Properties will be checked for value
      differences between the PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.
     Those properties checked off (other than Part Number)
      will not be transferred from the PartsDB to symbols.
     The following properties were checked off in the Property Definition Editor:
       "Value2"
       "IBIS"
       "Model Suffix"
       "VHDL Model"
       "Verilog Model"
       "Simulation Model"
       "Value"

     The present Common DataBase is up to date with the schematic
      source files.

     Common Data Base has been read

     Target PDB Name: Integration\LocalPartsDB.pdb

     Number of Part Numbers: 3
          Part Numb: 14_pin_dbl_.1sp -> Vend Part: 14_pin_dbl_.1sp 
          Part Numb: 20_pin_dbl_.1sp -> Vend Part: 20_pin_dbl_.1sp 
          Part Numb: 40_pin_dbl_.1sp -> Vend Part: 40_pin_dbl_.1sp 

     Number of Part Names: 0

     Number of Part Labels: 0


     Checking for value differences between non-null symbol properties and PartsDB properties,
      but only for those properties checked off in the Property Definition Editor

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.
     Clustering 3 Symbols:
               3  **
     Clustering is Complete

     Updating the Common DataBase

     A BAM WasIs List: Integration\CDBBackAnno.bam has been created.

     The Common DataBase has been successfully updated.

     Packager finished successfully.
     !THE CDB IS UP-TO-DATE!
     
     An unused pin and gate report has been written to Integration\UnusedPins.txt
     An unused gate report for gates not in schematic has been written to Integration\UnusedGates.txt
     An augmented pin report has been written to Integration\AugmentedPins.txt.
