     The schematic source is a Common Data Base.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the CDB only for parts not already found in the
      Target PDB.

     The FLATNETNAMEs status indicates that the present set
      of schematic netnames should be used to update the
      FLATNETNAMEs.

     WARNING:  The schematic source files have been modified since
      the present Common DataBase was compiled.  Please have the
      schematic designer recompile the CDB and rerun this procedure
      if it is desired to incorporate the latest changes.

     Common Data Base has been read

     Checking for value differences between symbol properties and PartsDB properties

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.
